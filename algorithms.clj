;; How to determine if two points of the graph
;; have a path between them, given a graph that is a set of points (vertices) and edges
;; between some of the pairs of these points? A path in the graph is a sequence of points
;; leading from source to destination with each pair having an edge that connects them.
;; If some path between two points exists, they belong to the same component, and if it
;; doesnâ€™t, to two disjoint ones.
