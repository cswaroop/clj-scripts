Here is an attempt to write clojure in literate programming style using EMACS ORG mode and its babel package

Repeated Shift-TAB will open and fold the document.

1. Clojure is installed with JVM and clojure can be invoked with =cmd-clj= on windows


Include NREPL server and middleware

https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli
https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.7.0/usage/server.html

Untangle this by running =C-c, C-v t=.  It creates a =deps.edn= with the following content.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure  :tangle  deps.edn
  {:paths ["src"]
   :deps {nrepl  {:mvn/version  "0.7.0"} 
          cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.25.2"} 
          ruiyun/tools.timer {:mvn/version "1.0.1"}
          mvxcvi/puget {:mvn/version "0.9.1"}
          adzerk/env  {:mvn/version "0.4.0"}
          com.cemerick/pomegranate {:mvn/version "0.3.0"}
          org.clojure/math.numeric-tower {:mvn/version "0.0.4"}}
   :aliases {:nREPL
             {:extra-deps
              {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "0.7.0"}}}}}
#+END_SRC

Start NREPL server

https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.7.0/usage/server.html

Run this by =C-c, C-c= . open the buffer my-nrepl

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (start-process "nrepl-process" "my-nrepl" "cmd-clj" "-R:nREPL -m nrepl.cmdline")
  #+END_SRC
  #+RESULTS:
  : #<process nrepl-process>

 Connect to NRepl  server from emacs

Connect to repl server by running =M-x cider-connect-clj=. and execute the following

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results output
  (println  "Hello World")
#+END_SRC
