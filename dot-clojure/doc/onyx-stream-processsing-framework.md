Data Driven API

What is it?
a masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, high performance distributed computation system
batch and stream hybrid processing model
exposes an information model for the description and construction of distributed workflows
Competes against Storm, Flink, Cascading, Cascalog, Spark, Map/Reduce, Sqoop, etc
written in pure Clojure
What would I use this for?
Realtime event stream processing
CQRS
Continuous computation
Extract, transform, load
Data transformation Ã  la map-reduce
Data ingestion and storage medium transfer
Data cleaning
