#+TITLE: Twirp
#+DESCRIPTION: Twirp is a framework for service-to-service communication emphasizing simplicity and minimalism. It generates routing and serialization from API definition files and lets you focus on your application's logic instead of thinking about folderol like HTTP methods and paths and JSON.

Define your service in a Protobuf file and then Twirp autogenerates Go code with a server interface and fully functional clients. It's similar to gRPC, but without the custom HTTP server and transport implementations: it runs on the standard library's extremely-well-tested-and-high-performance net/http Server. It can run on HTTP 1.1, not just http/2, and supports JSON clients for easy integrations across languages
