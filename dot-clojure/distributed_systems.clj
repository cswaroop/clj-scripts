;; State and behaviours grow fast with big distributed systems
;; Over a long enough time all the paths are hit

;; Monads, Futures, Actors, Supervisors, goroutines to reduce states instead of

;; Formal specification to model such a system?
;; Practical TLA+ Book - Hillel Wayne
;; Specifying sytems - Laslie Lamport
;; invariants (state, action, behaviour)
